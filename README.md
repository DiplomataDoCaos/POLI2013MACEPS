# POLI2013MACEPS
A safekeep repository of execises done at POLI-USP while I was first learning how to code

Those exercises were made during the Introduction to Programing classes at Escola Polit√©cnica (POLI-USP)

WARNING: Most code was really beginner-level (and some of it makes my young self shiver) - don't use as example of good code, unless you are starting your code journey

Also, given the Brazilian University, the code and comments are in portuguese and there are no plans to translate

EP1)
Simulate the monty python event: It's a implementation of this: https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problema_de_Monty_Hall

EP2)
SImulate multiple runs of the EP1 exercise and count the number of iterations to take statistics about it. Mainly to prove that swaping doors is a good strategy.

In other words: use a frequentist approch to measure the expected

EP3)
SImple 2D gravitational simulation - Actual only 5 functions needed to be coded, so actually most of the code isn't mine

EP4)
Implement a Lights Out game: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lights_Out_(game) and a resolver for the gameboard
